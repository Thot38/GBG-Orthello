     * <li> -1: empty board (a winning board for 1st player Black), 
     * <li> 0/1/...: Black's 1st move was tile 00/01/... (1-ply move, it should be a losing 
     * move. Then such a board is a winning board for 2nd player White)
     * </ul>
     * See {@link StateObserverHex} for the numbering of the tiles. <br>
     * {@link EvaluatorHex}, mode=10, will use all start boards for evaluation and 
     * return the average success.
     * <p>
     * Due to the 180-degree rotation symmetry it is sufficient to number the losing moves
     * on the left half of the board, including the vertical mid-line.
     * <p>
     * How to find out which boards are winning boards? - It is proven that the empty board is 
     * a winning board for all board sizes. The situation is more tricky for the 1-ply moves.
     * For small board sizes N<5, the exact value of each move can be calculated with Minimax. 
     * For larger board sizes, it is possible to use Hexy (a strong Hex playing program): Make
     * a starting move and see whether Hexy can win as 2nd player. However, this has to be done
     * manually for each starting move and each new board size.
